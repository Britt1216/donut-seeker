One group member should create a new Github repo for the project.
Navigate back to the repo's "Settings" page and then select "Branches" from the left sidebar.
Under "Branch Protection Rules" click "Add rule". In the "Branch name pattern" field, type "master" (note the capitalization).
You should be presented with some options below, check the following checkboxes:
"Require pull request reviews before merging"
"Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed"
"Require review from Code Owners"
"Include administrators"
If completed successfully, no one should be able to push directly to the master branch. Instead, all changes must be made in the form of pull requests (from other branches into master) that are first reviewed and then merged by another group member.
Once complete, invite the other group members as collaborators.
Hints
Make sure each invited group member checks their email and accepts the invitation.
Ask an instructor or TA for assistance if you get stuck!
