# donut-seeker
A project that allows a user to locate the closest donut shop to either a zip code or to their location. The user can either enter in a zip code and click on the "distant donut" button, or can click on the "find donut" button to receive information based on their current location. The application will then give the user the closest donut shop via a pop-up window. In the window, it gives the user the name, address, telephone number, overall rating, and the most recent review on the donut shop. The user can then click okay to have the pop-up disappear. The information is then reset and the user can search for more donuts.
